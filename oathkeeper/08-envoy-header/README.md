# Envoy and Oathkeeper

This example shows an example of using Oathkeeper with Envoy.

## Overview

Request flow:

1. Request lands on Envoy
1. Envoy uses ext_authz to forward authentication to http://oathkeeper/decision
   API
1. `cookie_session` authentication checks authentication and returns request
   back to Envoy
1. Hydrator adds an additional header to the request
1. Envoy proxies request to `hello` service
