# Example using Nginx with Ory Oathkeeper as decision API

This example shows an example of using Ory Oathkeeper with Nginx.

## Overview

Request flow:

1. Request lands on Nginx
1. Nginx uses the subrequest authentication module and passes it to Ory
   Oathkeepers decisions API.
1. `cookie_session` authentication checks authentication and returns it to
   Nginx.
1. Nginx proxies request to `hello` microservice.
