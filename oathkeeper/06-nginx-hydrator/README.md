# Example using Nginx with Ory Oathkeeper as decision API

This example shows an example of using Ory Oathkeeper with Nginx and hydrator
mutator.

## Overview

Request flow:

1. Request lands on Nginx
1. Nginx uses subrequest authentication module and passes it to
   oathkeeper/decisions API
1. `cookie_sesion` authentication checks authentication
1. Makes request to `hydrator` service and adds `X-User-Name` header
1. Nginx proxies request to `hello` service with `X-User: user_id`,
   `X-user-Name: andrew` headers

For more information, please refer to
[the Ory Oathkeeper documentation](https://www.ory.sh/docs/oathkeeper).
