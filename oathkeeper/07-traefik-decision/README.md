# Traefik and Ory Oathkeeper

This example shows an example of using Ory Oathkeeper with Traefik.

## Overview

Request flow:

1. Request lands on Traefik
1. Traefik uses forwardauth to forward authentication to
   http://oathkeeper/decision API
1. `cookie_sesion` authentication checks authentication and returns request back
   to Traefik
1. Hydrator adds an additional header to the request
1. Traefik proxies request to `hello` service

## Develop

Ory Oathkeeper Access Rules: [`access-rules.yml`](./oathkeeper/access-rules.yml)
Ory Oathkeeper Configuration: [`oathkeeper.yml`](./oathkeeper/oathkeeper.yml)
